# REMA Project 2025

This repo contains my (Amine Mike El Mallouf) project
for EPITA's [Recommender Systems course](https://github.com/oscar-defelice/Recommender-Systems-Course/tree/feat/new-version/src/FinalProject/project_2025).

This project is a comprehensive implementation of several recommender systems
explored in class. The code is organized in Python notebooks that can be found
in the [models/](models/) directory. The goal of this project is to demonstrate different
approaches to building recommendation models, including a **Hybrid Model**, a
**Two-Towers Neural Network**, and an **ALS (Alternating Least Squares)** model.
